# Arrows
A computational algebra system in [Cuis Smalltalk](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev).

The goal of the project is to build an extensible and mathematically rigorous environment where one can construct mathematical objects (such as groups, rings, modules, algebras, schemes, etc) and operate with them, their morphisms and their elements.

For more details refer to the [online documentation](https://github.com/len/Arrows/wiki) in the wiki.
